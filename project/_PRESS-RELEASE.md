There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Hotel Rating for Exercise

## Sub-Heading ##
  A product for traveling runners and fitness types who can view or rate hotels based on their running or exercise friendliness and accessibility.

## Summary ##
  This product is a hotel rating for the traveling runner or athlete who can either rate or view hotels based on their running and/or exercise accessibility. The rating is a score ranging from 1-10 that is crowdsourced/user-generated, and based on a number of factors including some of the following: having an onsite gym or swimming pool (e.g. weight/cardio equipment and hours), proximity to nearby parks and paths, presence of sidewalks on the road, general area safety, well-lit at night, etc. Its score is entirely based on feedback from other travelers. Fitness enthusiasts who will be traveling can now have the ability to research a better hotel option, as well as provide further feedback for the community sharing their experience.

## Problem ##
  There is currently no existing product like this on the market that focuses on this niche for travelers. All info presently needs to be independently gathered from various sources such as comments or pictures in Yelp, Trip Advisor, or Google Reviews. Other resources also include using Google Maps to determine what parks and paths are nearby and accessible. There is presently no dedicated way to share this info with others.

## Solution ##
  This app is a simple rating system similar to Yelp or Trip Advisor curated by the community of travelers who like to exercise. Its intent is to help make a more informed decision when researching hotel options for travel or vacation. The goal is to alleviate any frustration during the initial research phase over the uncertainty of having the ability to run or exercise while staying at a hotel. It also provides a place for users to rate hotels after their stay for the benefit of future travelers and the fitness community. The score is a point system based on a set number of pre-determined factors. Current solution is a simple interface that displays a hotel's basic info and its score. Future iterations would include searching by zip code, minimum score threshold, as well as connecting with third-party apps like the Strava API to view a heat map which generates suggested routes in the area.

## Quote from You ##
  "As runners and athletes ourselves, we recognize the struggle of wanting to maintain some semblance of basic fitness while traveling for
  work or on vacation. Often, we find that our hotel of choice is hit or miss in terms of exercise and working out options. We want this app to be simple and easy to use for all travelers out there who just want to know whether a hotel is going to be a viable and/or safe opportunity to exercise during their stay." -Brandon Brown

## How to Get Started ##
  Search for a hotel where you wish to stay. If that hotel is in the database, it will display its info and score. You can also provide your own
  rating which contributes to the aggregate score, or add a new hotel and your score to the system for other users to view.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I always try to go on a run while traveling or on vacation, and I wish I had this app a long time ago to help me make a better
  choice of where to stay in an unfamiliar city."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Our hope is that this app benefits our users and is a value-add to their travel experience. Visit our site now and enter a hotel to get
  started!
